Todo:

Tb tested:

Done:
- Remove Filt column from the summary tables
- Add duplication/deletion to paired approach
- Remove Total from the plots
- Check title in the plots esp. 6.4
- Summary table of all CNVs
- scaling of y-axis for single plots
- Add new profiles for execution in the cluster
- Add the paired approach
- Add resources to the tasks
- Add summary of all comparisions
- summary table CNs for single and paired
- Write description of the pipeline and the columns (also shedule a meeting with the developer Lucia Trastulla)
- Add loss of heterozygousity; Check if this is covered in the single analysis
--> not covered, but there is an option in bcftools that we may use, all downstream needs to be implemented though
- Create a rmd report for the comparisions and the single analysis (karyogramm, tables etc, LRR BAF plots that can be zoomed)
- LOH missing, how can it be added
